==========

John Conway's Game of Life built in C++ using openFrameworks on Mac.

To use, install openFrameworks from http://openframeworks.cc/download/ and copy the contents of this repo into a folder in apps/myApps under your openFrameworks installation


You should also be able to run the debug app at bin/gameOfLifeDebug.app -- I haven't tested this on any machine besides my own though.
